The repository contains all my assignments and coding for Front End Web Development with React on Coursera.
This course is taught by Professor Jogesh K Mupalla from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

### The individual assignments can be accessed through the commit log. 

## I humbly request you to try to complete the assignments on your own first. 
They are simple and are necessary in laying your foundation for React based Web Development.

## This repository should be used only for reference and not a solution.
